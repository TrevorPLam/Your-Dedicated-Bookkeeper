# TODO.md — Repository Task List

Document Type: Workflow
Last Updated: 2026-01-09
Task Truth Source: **TODO.md**

This file is the single source of truth for actionable work. If another document disagrees, the task record in this file wins (unless the Constitution overrides).

## Goals (from chat)
- Site: High-performance marketing site for “Your Dedicated Marketer”
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (GitHub integration)
- Standard: Diamond Standard (performance, accessibility, observability, testing)
- Keep: Sentry, PWA, Search
- Contact flow: Store lead in Supabase (server-only) + sync to HubSpot CRM
	- No email sending
	- Save suspicious submissions but flag them (suspicious = too many requests)
	- Required fields: Name, Email, Phone
	- UX: Return success even if HubSpot sync fails (best-effort)
